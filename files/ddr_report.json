  "property_issue_summary": "The property is experiencing widespread dampness and leakage across multiple internal areas, specifically in halls, bathrooms, bedrooms, and the kitchen, often observed at skirting levels. This is accompanied by significant plumbing defects, including concealed leaks, damaged Nahani traps, and loose joints, as well as structural and envelope issues such as tile hollowness, gaps in tile joints, and various cracks in external walls, RCC columns, and beams. Furthermore, continuous leakage is noted at the parking ceiling below Flat No. 103 and from cracked external plumbing pipes, along with visible algae and moss on external surfaces.",

  "root_cause_analysis": "The probable root cause is systemic water ingress resulting from a combination of compromised plumbing systems and building envelope deficiencies. Explicit evidence points to failures in concealed plumbing, damaged Nahani traps, loose plumbing joints, and cracked external plumbing pipes as direct sources of leakage. These are exacerbated by structural issues such as gaps in tile joints, tile hollowness, and significant cracks in both external walls and structural RCC columns and beams, creating multiple pathways for persistent moisture penetration.",
  "severity_assessment": {
    "level": "High",
    "reasoning": "The issue is assessed as High severity due to the widespread and continuous nature of water ingress affecting multiple critical areas of the property, including internal living spaces and structural elements. The presence of cracks on RCC columns and beams, coupled with major cracks on external surfaces, indicates potential structural compromise. Additionally, 'all time' leakage and observed leakage at the parking ceiling below a flat further escalate the risk, signifying a major system failure and potential safety concerns if not addressed promptly."
  },
  "recommended_actions": [
    "Immediately repair all identified plumbing issues, including concealed leaks, damaged Nahani traps, loose joints, and cracked external plumbing pipes, to stop ongoing water leakage.",
    "Address tile problems by repairing or replacing hollow tiles and re-grouting all open tile joints in bathrooms, bedrooms, and other affected areas to prevent water seepage.",
    "Conduct a thorough structural assessment to evaluate cracks in RCC columns, beams, and external walls. Implement appropriate repairs to ensure structural stability and safety.",
    "Repair all external wall cracks and duct issues. Clean and treat external surfaces affected by algae, fungus, and moss to protect the building envelope.",
    "Investigate and repair the source of leakage affecting the parking ceiling below Flat No. 103.",
    "Address internal dampness and efflorescence at skirting levels and wall surfaces in halls, bedrooms, and kitchens, following the resolution of primary water sources."

  "additional_notes": "No conflicting information was reported. The diagnosis is based on available visual and thermal observation data.",
  "missing_information": [
    "Detailed thermal imaging data, which could help pinpoint concealed moisture, is not available for most visually identified damp areas like halls, bathrooms, bedrooms, and the kitchen.",
    "While hotspot temperatures are provided for several measurement points, specific visual context or location mapping for these thermal readings is missing.",
    "Further specifics regarding the exact locations and types of plumbing system failures (e.g., specific pipe sections, joint types, or fixture leaks) beyond general descriptions would assist in more targeted repairs."
